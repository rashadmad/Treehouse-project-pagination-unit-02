# Treehouse-project-pagination-unit-02
In this project, you'll use a common web development technique known as "pagination" to enhance the usability of a web page.  

## Instructions
You'll start with a page that contains a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses. You'll write JavaScript to display 10 names at a time, and add a navigation system -- a series of links at the bottom of the page -- to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time.  While making these improvements, you'll use the principle of "progressive enhancement." The page should still display the students' names without JavaScript turned on, but will be much improved (enhanced) with the JavaScript programming you add. In other words, you'll add JavaScript to paginate and improve the project, without altering the project in such a way that JavaScript is required to use the web page.  Your pagination solution will need to work with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied list of 54 students. This means your solution needs to be flexible enough to respond to lists of different lengths.  After completing this project, you'll have some powerful JavaScript skills and a strong second portfolio piece to show off to potential employers.
